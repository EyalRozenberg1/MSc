This is to compare the results with the gradient in simulation results of 2017_06_15

w0 	    = 95e-6 [m]
TempGrad    = 1. Linear
	      2. Apodized
Pump 	    = Depleted
T.pm 	    = 149.4695;

L 	    = 5e-2
Alpha Las:
PinAvg      = 100e-3;
f           = 100;
Pulse_wdt   = 1e-9;

for current simulation:
samples     = 200;
dx_prop     = 5e-6;

Notes: For the Efficiency vs GradDiff we can see that we dont get maximum at const temperature, this is as a results of T.pm mismatch. 
       The value was chosen to be close but not accurate
