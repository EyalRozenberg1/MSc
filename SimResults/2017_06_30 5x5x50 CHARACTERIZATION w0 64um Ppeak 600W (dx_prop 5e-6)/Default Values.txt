This is in order to comaper with Cherecterization of 2017_05_28 after checking the 
real waists (w0) in the experiment
(To check if there is an error with its experiment calculation)

w0 	    = 45.5*sqrt(2)*1e-6
xi 	    = 1

TempGrad    = Const
Pump 	    = Depleted
T.pm 	    = 149.2574

L 	    = 5e-2

Lus:
PinAvg      = 30e-3;
f           = 10K;
Pulse_wdt   = 5e-9;

for current simulation:
samples     = 200;
dx_prop     = 5e-6;
