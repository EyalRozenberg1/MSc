  abstract = {Phase-matched nonlinear processes exhibit a tradeoff between the conversion efficiency and the acceptance bandwidth. Adiabatic nonlinear processes, in which the phase mismatch varies slowly along the interaction length, enable us to overcome this tradeoff, allowing an efficient frequency conversion with broad spectral and thermal bandwidths. Until now, the variation in the phase mismatch condition was mainly based on quasi-phase matching in ferroelectric crystals. However, this solution is limited to low power sources. Here, instead, we study the adiabatic second harmonic in birefringently phase-matched lithium triborate crystal, enabling us to handle much higher power levels. The variation in the phase mismatch is achieved by inducing a temperature gradient along the crystal. By using a 50\&\#x00A0;mm long crystal, the adiabatic process provided a temperature bandwidth of 18\&\#x00B0;C, 5.4 times wider than what is achieved when the same crystal is held at the fixed phase-matching temperature. The conversion efficiency exceeded 60\% for a 0.9\&\#x00A0;millijoule pump pulse.},
