# Nonlinear optical interaction adiabatic-apodized temperature profile
Simulations of nonlinear optical interaction within LBO crystal via adiabatic-apodized temperature profile to create an efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), and Gouy Phase compensation of SHG to achieve an efficient interaction using a unique temperature profile.
